# Bitburner scripts.
This is my personal repo of the "Typescript template for Bitburner's Remote File API" as seen [here.](https://github.com/bitburner-official/typescript-template)

It contains all the scripts i have created for the game Bitburner, a game played by running the scripts the player creates.
